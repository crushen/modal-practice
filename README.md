# Modal Practice

### A simple app created whilst learning how Bootstrap modals work.

I focused on learning how to do 3 things with modals:

* Enlarging images when clicking on a the picture.
* Going to a picture gallery when clicking on a thumbnail.
* Opening and playing Youth videos when clicking on a thumbnail. This one was quite challenging as the default behavior means the videos would carry on playing in the background once you've exited the modal.
